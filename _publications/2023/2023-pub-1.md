  Electromagnetic mini valves have attracted great interest in medical devices for their excellent performance and high integration. In state-of-the-art research, most mini valves have only two working states, while certain ones featuring three to four working states necessitate multiple driving sources. To solve these problems, a novel tristable electromagnetic mini valve with three stable working states achieved by a single coil was proposed. The actuation mechanism of this mini valve mainly comprises a cylindrical magnet (CM) and a ring magnet (RM) coaxially arranged. In the absence of current through the coil, the stability of the magnets is upheld by their mutual repulsion and the attraction of the iron core. Upon modifying both the magnitude and orientation of the current, one of the magnets traverses from one terminus to another each time. The two magnets are either stationary at the start point or the endpoint. Thereby, four position relationships are formed, three of which are stable. The minimum response time and energy consumption are 3.75 ms and 0.013 J, respectively. The working pressure of the valve ranges from 0 to 200 kPa. The maximum flow rate and back pressure reach 10.5 L/min and 180 kPa, respectively. A tristable design contributes to lower energy consumption, and the three-working-state function actuated by a single coil facilitates a diminution in the size of the mini valve. Consequently, a diminished quantity of valves is realized for multiple degree-of-freedom pneumatic actuator control, which promotes the miniaturization of the whole system. The dimensions and performance of the proposed mini valve substantiate its potential in pneumatic medical devices.
