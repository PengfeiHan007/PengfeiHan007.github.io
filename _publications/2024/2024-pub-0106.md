  As core components of microfluidic and wearable pneumatic electronic systems, mini valves are attracting a growing intellectual interest. However, most existing mini valve exhibit either excessive energy consumption or limited flow rate and holding pressure. To address these issues, this study proposes an energy-saving mini valve with large flow rate and high holding pressure. The implementation of electromagnetic bistable structure allows the valve to remain open or closed without energy consumption. In contrast to the small and intricate flow channels seen in conventional mini valves, the straight-through flow channel design with reduced flow resistance improves its flow rate properties. And the pressure resistance characteristics are enhanced by the use of permanent magnetic attraction for sealing. Furthermore, the valve is driven by a single coil to switch between two steady states, resulting in a more compact structure. We have developed valve prototypes with diameters of 10 mm and 6 mm. Performance evaluation tests have shown that it sustains a holding pressure as high as 100 kPa and a flow rate of 1.5 L/min (@ 3 kPa), while only expending an energy of 0.37 J during switch transitions. Given these attributes, this valve demonstrates significant potential for integration within wearable pneumatic electronic systems.
