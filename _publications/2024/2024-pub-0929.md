  The present research delves into the realm of multi-state mini valves, a subject of considerable intrigue due to their integrative capabilities within pneumatic actuator systems. Although it has been widely recognized that mini valves are used in numerous applications, the majority of current mini valves have three or fewer working states. Furthermore, those uncommon valves capable of operating in four working states exhibit limitations, including the necessity for multiple driving sources and elevated operational energy requirements.  Addressing these impediments, our study introduces an innovative electromagnetic valve design (R7.5Ã—30 mm) that facilitates the switching among four discrete operational states under the governance of a singular electrical power source. This valve attains four stable operational states by coordinating interactions between the upper and lower iron cores, a ring magnet, and a cylindrical magnet. The valve maintains a leakage rate that is nearly zero under pressures up to 250 kPa. Furthermore, rapid transitions between states are achievable by momentarily electrifying the valve's coils, with peak transition response time and energy expenditure being only 7.50 ms and 0.540 J, respectively. Leveraging this quad-state valve mechanism, the study unveils the precise control over the locomotion and directional maneuvers of a pneumatic soft inchworm-like walker, culminating in a propulsion velocity of 0.072 BL/s. This achievement underscores the latent potential of multi-state valves in the miniaturization of pneumatic systems.
