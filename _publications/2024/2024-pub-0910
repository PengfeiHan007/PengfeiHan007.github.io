Recently, there has been active research in developing robotic catheter systems for treating cardiac arrhythmia. 
Nevertheless, state-of-the-art studies on ablation catheters typically exhibit a force-position coupling phenomenon and a low control accuracy without sensors. 
To solve these issues, a hybrid pneumatic and tendon-driven soft ablation catheter (R4.5×50 mm) using a sensor-free force-position decoupled control approach was proposed in this article. 
To realize decoupled control, the catheter’s force and position are actuated by air pressure and tendons, respectively. This allows the two operating modes, outputting force and moving tip position, to be controlled independently. 
To manipulate its force and position more precisely, this research suggested a neural network-based control methodology. 
The disparity between the theoretical model and the actual condition is eliminated by training the experiment data. 
Compared with the traditional model-based control technologies, the force and position mean error decreases from 0.02 N to 0.013 N and 1.43 mm to 0.59 mm, respectively. 
The bandwidth is approximately 0.33 Hz. This research has been demonstrated to decrease control errors without sensors.
Future work will focus on perfecting the control framework to enable the catheter to be used in the cardiac ablation procedure.
